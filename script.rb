# I don't have a player class to inherit from at the time of writing this comment
# THis is because I don't see any shared functionality between them
# The code maker must generate and store a code, then compare a given input with it and output the response
# The code breaker must create a sequence and the game must pass it to see if it matches up
# If it does then the breaker wins but if not then the maker returns some information about the positions of the colours
